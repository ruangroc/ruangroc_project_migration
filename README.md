ST441 Project: Radiation and Gravity Models for Simulating Human Migration Patterns

This project is a much simpler, smaller version of of the work Caleb Robinson and Bistra Dilkina completed in ["A Machine Learning Approach to Modeling Human Migration"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3209811.3209868). 
They developed a machine learning framework to improve predictions for human migration patterns and compared it to several traditional migration models. 
This project would involve only implementing and comparing a radiation model and a gravity model in R and using the historical migration data provided in the article to make predictions about migration patterns in the future.
