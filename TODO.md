### Milestones and Estimated Deadlines

By the end of:   
 
* Week 5 (Nov. 1): Research the necessary math behind the gravity and radiation models. Create a Markdown document to collect notes and online resources.  
* Week 6 (Nov. 8): Implement a gravity model and use it to model human migration patterns using historical data.  
* Week 7 (Nov. 15): Implement a radiation model and use it to human migration patterns using historical data.  
* Week 8 (Nov. 22): Compare how the two models differ in modeling historical data. Simulate predictions of human migration patterns in the future and compare how the two models differ in predicting patterns.  
* Week 9 (Nov. 29): Code is complete and fully reproducible (first project deliverable: reproducible code in GitHub repo).  
* Week 10 (Dec. 6): 2-page project report and full technical documentation are complete (the final project deliverables).
