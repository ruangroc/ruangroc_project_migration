## Background research
As seen in the image below and as explained in Caleb Robinson and Bistra Dilkina's paper, ["A Machine Learning Approach to Modeling Human Migration"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3209811.3209868), the traditional migration models can be written as the product of two parts: $T_{ij} = G_i * P_{ij}$. 

  * $T_{ij}$ is the number of people moving from every zone i to every other zone j
  * $G_i = \alpha * m_i$ is the production function that estimates number of people leaving zone i
    * $m_i$ is the population of zone i and $\alpha$ is a parameter tuned using historical data
  * $P_{ij}$ is the probability of a move occurring from i to j
    * Robinson and Dilkina note that the probability of moving from i to all other destinations j should sum to 1

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("documentation", "project_notes", "Robinson_and_Dilkina_Table_1.PNG"))
```

I'll be using the alpha value of 0.3 that Robinson and Dilkina used in their paper to substitute for the beta variables in the gravity model with power law equation, which is what they appeared to do in their [MigrationModels.py](https://github.com/calebrob6/migration-lib/blob/master/MigrationModels.py) file.


## Create distances matrix for all (i, j)
```{r}
if (!file.exists(here("results", "distances_between_states.csv"))) {
  create_distance_matrix()
}
```



Let's run this function for all the yearly data we have on hand.
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pop_estimates <- read.csv(here("results", "data_cleaning_results", "population_estimates.csv"))
locations <- read.csv(here("results", "distances_between_states.csv"))
columns <- colnames(pop_estimates)
alpha <- 0.3

# create appropriate results directory if it doesn't already exist
if (!dir.exists(here("results", "gravity_model_results"))) {
  dir.create(here("results", "gravity_model_results"))
}

result <- map(columns, ~ generate_gravity_matrices(., pop_estimates, alpha, locations))
```
